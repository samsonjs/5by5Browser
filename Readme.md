# 5by5 Browser

Easily browse my favourite 5by5 shows, get to the show notes, and add links to Instapaper. Fork and tailor the list to be your favourite shows if you like.

If you want to use the Instapaper button copy `InstapaperCredentials.h.example` to `InstapaperCredentials.h`, remove the error line, and add your credentials.
